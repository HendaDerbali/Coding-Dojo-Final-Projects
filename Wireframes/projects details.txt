		** Description of the Solo projects **

I did two solo projects

*/ The first one : in a plateform wireframe : 1654264630__chore_tracker 

*/ The Second One : Henda's E-commerce web site :  This is the beginning of an e-commerce website (online sales)
This website can have one or more admins: their role is to publish categories and products.
One Super Admin : he can delete even other admins ( he is me )

Users (who are not admins) can log in, add selected products to their purchasing list, they can also comment, like the selected products ...
The goal is then to use Spring Boot MVC and Spring Boot Security for the Backend part ans JSP for Front End 

*/ In the future ,i want to integrate them with  React for the Front End part
